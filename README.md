 Here is an example README file with detailed information for this assignment:

# Toy Problems Solution

This repository contains solutions to 3 toy problems for a weekly coding assignment.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files:

- `solutions.js`: Contains JavaScript code solving the 3 toy problems.
- `README.md`: This file providing overview documentation.

## Problems

The following 3 toy problems are solved:

1. **Student Grade Generator**: Takes in a student score input and returns the corresponding letter grade.

2. **Speed Detector**: Accepts a car speed input and calculates demerit points for speeds over 70 km/h, returning license suspended message if over 12 points.

3. **Net Salary Calculator**: Calculates tax, deductions and net salary given basic salary and benefits. Returns this information in an object.

## Solutions

The `solutions.js` file includes detailed comments explaining each solution and the logic/calculations being performed.

Key points:

- Uses JavaScript to implement the logic for each problem.
- Follows the input/output criteria laid out in the assignment. 
- Makes use of control flow statements, arithmetic operations, functions and objects to model each scenario.

## Usage

To test the solutions:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `solutions.js` using Node.js to display outputs
3. Modify input values to validate under different conditions
4. Review code comments to understand the implementation

## Submission

This assignment solution was submitted via GitHub repo link for grading.
